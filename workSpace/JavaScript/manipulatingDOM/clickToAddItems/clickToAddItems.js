/*We will be using the document.forms collection to loop through our form components. Since we have a name on our form, we are using the form's name as our index in the brackets.

When we have an error, we will be adding the Bootstrap class has-error to the related form-group. We will use the parentElement object to look at the parent of the <input> control that we are validating. When we check the parent element, we are looking at its class attribute, specifically checking to see if it contains the string "has-". The indexOf() function indicates the position of where the text appears, and if the text isn't found, indexOf() returns the value of -1.

When we are clearing errors, we need to remove the has-error CSS class. We will reset the parent's CSS class to simply form-group.

In your repository, create an HTML file named clickToAddItems.js.
Add the following code to this file: clickToAddItems.js

function clearErrors() {
  //using for loop to run through the document.forms collection
  //document.forms["numberFun"] we use[]to denote the name of the forms
  for (var loopCounter = 0; loopCounter < document.forms["numberFun"].elements.length; loopCounter++) {
    if (document.forms["numberFun"].elements[loopCounter]
      .parentElement.className.indexOf("has-") != -1) {
      document.forms["numberFun"].elements[loopCounter].parentElement.className = "form-group";
    }
  }
}

// When we reset the form, we need to:
//
// Clear the errors
// Clear the values in the <input> elements
// Hide the table of results

// In this function, we will use the clearErrors() function we just created. We will also be calling a function called focus(), which allows us to put the cursor in a control and make it the active control. In this case, it is a good user experience in that once the user clears the form, their cursor will return to the num1 textbox.
function resetForm() {
  clearErrors();
  document.forms["numberFun"]["num1"].value = "";
  document.forms["numberFun"]["num2"].value = "";
  document.getElementById("results").style.display = "none";
  document.getElementById("submitButton").innerText = "Submit";
  document.forms["numberFun"]["num1"].focus();
}

// In validating a form, you are checking to make sure that the user input expected values. In this case, we want to make sure that:
//
// num1 and num2 are filled in (required).
// num1 and num2 are numbers - or at least can be treated like numbers in JavaScript.
// In this function, we will use the clearErrors() function so that we can reset our errors state to a cleared state. We will then use value to get the entered value from the <input> boxes. If those values are either empty ("") or not a number (isNaN()), then we will:
//
// Display an alert() message that the respective input box needs to be a number.
// Add the Bootstrap has-error class to the form-group
// Set the focus() to the input box in error
// Return false to prevent form submission.
// If all fields are validated successfully, then we will show the results table with the mathematical results.

document.getElementById("divideResult").innerText = num1 / num2;
// We are returning false so that the form doesn't submit
// and so that we can see the results
return false;
}

// We are returning false at the end so that we can see the table of results. If you change this to true, the form would submit to whatever you set for the form's action attribute. Since we are only focusing on form validation in this example, we are returning false and keeping our output on this page. Typically, form data gets submitted to some other page on a server, which then does things with the form data and may return a response.
