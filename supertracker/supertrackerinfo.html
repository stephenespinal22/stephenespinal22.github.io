        <h1>Project: 'SuperTracker' </h1>
        <h2>Documentation/Info</h2>
        <section>

            <p>‚óè Technologies Used: Java, Spring Boot, JDBC Template, MySQL, Thymeleaf,
                Leaflet, JavaScript, CSS/Bootstrap</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/stephenespinal22/M9SuperHeroSJC" target="_blank">source code</a>
            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker1.png" alt="First slide">
            <div class="caption"><em>Home Page with map of recent sightings. This page will display the 10 most recent
                    sightings</em></div>

            <p>This project is a multi-page dynamic Spring Boot Full Stack Web Application using
                the MVC design pattern and incorporating a MySQL database. For the front-end I used Thymeleaf which
                is a modern server-side Java template engine.
                This allows us to build HTML pages and put some logic in the HTML so we can conditionally render
                pieces of the page or render lists.It allows users to create, read/view, update, and delete (CRUD) on 5
                objects. These objects are Sightings, Characters, Locations
                (using reverse GeoCoding), Organizations, and Powers</p>
            <p>It's an application I made as a project for my coding bootcamp. For this project, I was made project
                manager, where I directed and oversaw
                2 group members throughout the entire application, supplying shells/ layouts for all classes and
                wireframes for the front-end, all in addition to
                coding/debugging most of the project. We constantly pushed work through github where I helped with minor
                merge conflicts. We also frequently met
                through video calls like google hangouts, where we could share our screen and work out issues together.
            </p>

            <p>The main feature of this application is the ability to keep track of 'super-heroes' and their sightings.
                It's a playful
                concept that obviously wouldn't have a use in the real world, but swap the nouns and the concept is
                resusable.
                The app allows users to mark sighting location coordinates on a map using a map API, keep track of which
                organizations a 'Super' is a part of, and their super powers. All data is retained using a MySQL
                database
                for data persistance.
            </p>

            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker7.png" alt="First slide">
            <div class="caption"><em>This is the sightings screen, here you can create update and delete sightings</em>
            </div>

            <p>One of the key features is seeing all the sightings of a 'Super'. Here you can add a sighting by using
                the form on the right.
                You can choose the location and the date/time they were spotted.
            </p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker9.png">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker8.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>This is the 'Supers' screen, here you can create update and delete 'Supers'</em>
            </div>

            <p>Another one of the key features is managing all the 'Supers'. Here you can add a 'Super' by using the
                form on the right.
                You can choose the super's powers and organizations from a list. A 'Super' object is made up of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <u><strong>Super Object Class Structure</strong></u>
                <li>Id</li>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Image Path</li>
                <li>isVillain (Y/N)</li>
                <li>List Of: Powers</li>
                <li>List Of: Organizations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supers have Powers and are a part of Organizations. These are other objects that
                both have a many to many relationship with Supers.</p>

            <div class="phone-size-container">
                <img class="phone-size" src="../landingPageImages/tracker10.gif" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>The layout is also responsive, so heres what it looks like on a phone</em>
            </div>

            <p>When on a smaller screen, the table that holds the supers, is modified for better use on a smaller screen. The nav bar also changes to a different 
                layout as a neat bonus. This was done using CSS media queries on different page sizes.
                You'll also notice there are images tied to supers. This was accomplished using the dropbox API to
                upload images directly to a dropbox
                account that I set up
                for this site. It's pretty cool using this as a free way to store images. This wouldn't cut it in a real
                world application,
                but I found it to be resourceful.</p>
            <p>
                The app also allows users to update Powers and Organizations in a similar way to the other objects on
                their own pages as shown below.</p>


            <div class="col-12">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker11.png">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/tracker12.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>The organizations and powers pages</em></div>

            <p>These (CRUD) screens use Data Tables as a cool framework with Bootstrap that allows for pagination of
                tables. It also allows
                for a very developer-friendly search feature. Now for the last object, Locations.
            </p>

            <div class="phone-size-container">
                <img class="medium2-size" src="../landingPageImages/tracker13.gif" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>This is the add location screen, here you can click on areas of the map to reverse
                    geocode an address that will auto-populate in the forms fields</em>
            </div>

            <p>This was pretty cool to read up on how to do. I reseached for map API's and came across
                Leaflet/OpenStreetMap. I added the necessary CDN's to my HTML and was ready to figure it out.
                The documentation/framework helped me write some JavaScript that was able to create a map object and
                allow for clicks to return back an address and coordinates. I manipulated this data to populate in my
                form which
                seemed like a cool thing.
            </p>

            <p>Using the same API I was able to work out the markers for the sightings on the map. When the map for
                sightings is open
                there is a loop that runs through the most recent 20 sightings grabbing their coordinates and placing a
                marker on each location.
                If two sightings are in the same location, a spiderfier I found will create a branch of markers
                displaying more than one at a location.
            </p>

            <div class="caption"><em>Example of the markers showing super's sightings</em></div>

            <p>There was alot more that went into building this project, you can check out the <u> source code</u><a
                    href="https://github.com/stephenespinal22/M9SuperHeroSJC" target="_blank"> here</a>.
                This links to an earlier build before I added dropbox functionality (final product repo must remain private due
                to API key) and before I added extra CSS to
                create the responsive tables. You can also see the DDL for the database and the ERD.
                If you would like to test out the application, visit it <a href="https://sedev-supertracker.herokuapp.com"
