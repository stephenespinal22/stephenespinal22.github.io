            <p>‚óè Technologies Used: Java, Spring Boot, JDBC Template, MySQL, Thymeleaf,
                JavaScript, Spring Security</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/stephenespinal22/SoftwareGuildWork/tree/master/Classwork/M9/Mastery" target="_blank">source code</a>
            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/blog1.png" alt="First slide" style="padding-top: 10px;">
            <div class="caption"><em>Home Page with admin side-bar active. This page will display the 4 most recent
                    posts</em></div>

            <p>This project is a multi-page dynamic Spring Boot Full Stack Web Application using
                the MVC design pattern and incorporating a MySQL database and Spring Security. For the front-end I used
                Thymeleaf which
                is a
                modern server-side Java template engine.
                This allows us to build HTML pages and put some logic in the HTML so we can conditionally render
                pieces of
                the page or render lists.
                It's an application I made as a project for my coding bootcamp.
                It allows users to create, read/view, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts.</p>

            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/blog4.png" alt="First slide">
            <div class="caption"><em>This is the main content screen anyone can visit to see all posts</em></div>

            <p>The posts are displayed as these "cards" that have the basic properties that
                make up the Post object. A post is made up of:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <u><strong>Post Object Class Structure</strong></u>
                <li>Id</li>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>Preview Text</li>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Content</li>
                <li>isPublished (Y/N)</li>
                <li>Featured Image Path</li>
                <li>User/Author</li>
                <li>List Of: Categories</li>
                <li>List Of: Hash Tags</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Posts have categories and hashtags. These are other objects that
                both have a many to many relationship with Posts.</p>
            <p>Below, I added some comments to this image to show how each property is displayed.</p>

            <div class="phone-size-container">
                <img class="medium-size" src="../landingPageImages/blog6.png" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>The layout is also responsive, so heres what it looks like on a phone</em>
            </div>

            <p>The app also allows users to have different roles with security that hides website
                functionality based on role. This was achieved using Spring Security. These roles are Admin and
                Contributer.
                So this means that anyone who doesn't have log-in information can only view Home and Content.</p>
            <p>Once a user logs in, They gain more functionality such as they above mentioned (CRUD) for posts. Let's
                log in as a contributer.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/bloggif1.gif">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <img class="w-100" src="../landingPageImages/bloggif2.gif">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>Log-in using the side-bar button and you can view/manage all posts you have
                    made</em></div>

            <p>The table in the right gif was made to be responsive. Here's what it looks like on a phone or smaller
                screen. This was done using CSS media queries on different page sizes.</p>

            <div class="phone-size-container">
                <img id="responsive" class="medium-size" src="../landingPageImages/bloggif3.gif" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>The table is responsive, so heres what it looks like on a phone</em>
            </div>
            <p>The side-bar has allowed access to new features. A button to create posts, and another to manage them.</p>

            <img class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/bloggif4.gif" alt="First slide">
            <div class="caption"><em>Here, a user can create a new post and upload an image with the post using this
                    form</em></div>

            <p>The Post content input area uses TinyMCE which is a great text editor that can be used for writing up a
                post.</p> Here the user finds access to
            choose which pre-determined category the post falls under (these are admin only in terms creating or
            managing, as by design). The user can create and add hash tags within
            the TinyMCE content area. Simply type in a '#' followed by a series of words, no spaces to automaticall
            create a new hash tag
            in the database. Ex. "#thisisahashtag". If the hash tag already exists, the program does not create a new
            one, but still adds it to the post.
            Using the search function in content or when mananing posts, you can search by hash tag and all posts with
            that hash tag should show up. This was accomplished by a Regex expression that is used to match any strings
            with that pattern and when
            a match is found, it adds it to the database.</p>

            <p>You'll also notice there are images on the site, with the
                user's and
                with the posts. This was accomplished using the dropbox API to upload images directly to a dropbox
                account that I set up
                for this site. It's pretty cool using this as a free way to store images. This wouldn't cut it in a real
                world application,
                but I found it to be resourceful. </p>
            <p> Now although any contributer can create a post, and view/manage their own posts, the post will not go
                'live' unless approved by an admin.
                The property 'isPublished' will not be set to true unless an admin goes in and approves it. Let's move
                on to admins.
            </p>

            <div class="phone-size-container">
                <img class="phone-size" src="../landingPageImages/blog7.png" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <div class="caption"><em>A closer look at the full access features</em>
            </div>

            <p>Admin's have total access to everything a contributer can do in addition to, edit and create users, give
                user's roles, approve posts, manage all published posts, manage
                categories and hashtags. An admin will recieve a numbered badge with the number of posts waiting to
                be approved, 3 posts are waiting to be approved in this image.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-4">

            <div class="caption"><em>Here's some photos of the admin's main features. These are also responsive similar
                    to the manage posts view shown <a href="#responsive">above</a></em></div>

            <p>Admin's will be able to check off on a users post by clicking the green check marked, 'Approve'. They can
                also view all published posts and edit them on the fly without removing the post from the main feed of
                already published posts.
            </p>

            <img id="bottom" class="d-block w-100" src="../landingPageImages/blog11.png" alt="First slide">
            <div class="caption"><em>What a post looks like... Plus comments</em></div>

            <p> User's can view the post in it's own page that can be linked. Also if you are logged in, you can add
                comments to a post. Contributer's can only delete their own
                comments and an admin can delete any comment.
            </p>

            <p>There was alot more that went into building this project, you can check out the <u> source code</u><a
                    href="https://github.com/stephenespinal22/SoftwareGuildWork/tree/master/Classwork/M9/Mastery"
                    target="_blank"> here</a>.
                This links to an earlier build before I added dropbox functionality (final repo must remain private due
                to API key) and before I added extra CSS to
                create the responsive tables. You can also see the DDL for the database, the ERD, and the project's UML.
                If you would like to test out the application, visit it <a href="https://sedev-blogsite.herokuapp.com"
                    target="_blank">here</a>. Since you took out the time
                to read this, you can try out the contributer features by using the login Jim Halpert and the password
                is password.</p>
